# Purpose of the .github Repository:
The .github repository is intended for organization-wide defaults. Files placed here (including a README.md) serve as defaults for repositories that do not have their own versions of these community files.


# Organization Profile Customization:
While you can include a README.md in your organization’s .github repository, its content will not be displayed on the organization’s landing (profile) page. Instead, organization profiles are customized through the settings page, where you can add a description, website link, location, and other details.
